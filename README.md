Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository includes the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data”.

The dataset used is “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones” available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The code assumes that all the data is present in the UCI HAR Dataset folder, un-compressed and placed in the working directory.

“CodeBook.md” describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.	

“run_analysis.R” is the R script that performs the analyses through the 5 steps described in the CodeBook.m generating the output file called “tidy_data.txt”.
